### Mod1. Time Value of Money: Intuition & Discounting
+ Discounting: move CF back in time (\\(t<0\\))
+ Compounding: move CF forward in time (\\(t>0\\))
+ discount factor
+ \\((1+R)^{t}\\)
+ Never add/subtract cash flows from different time periods
+ Use a timeline to help formulate problems
+ Present value:
  - denote: \\(PV_{s}(CF_{t})\\) as of time \\(s\\) of a cash flow at time \\(t>s\\)
  - meaning:
    + the value of future cash flows
    + the price of a claim to those cash flows
+ Future value:
  - denote: \\(FV_{s}(CF_{t})\\)
  - \\(FV_{s}(CF_{t})=CF_{t}(1+R)^{s-t}\\) for \\(t<s\\)
