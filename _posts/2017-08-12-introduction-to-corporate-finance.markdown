### Mod1. Time Value of Money: Intuition & Discounting
+ Money has a time unit
+ Get in the habit of placing cash flows on a time line
![Timeline](/images/finance_mod1_1.png)
+ Discount Factor: exchange rate for time
+ \\((1+R)^{t}\\)
  -  \\(R\\) is the rate of return offered by investment alternatives in the markets of equivalent risk (a.k.a. discount rate, hurdle rate, opportunity cost of capital)
  - To determine \\(R\\), consider the risk of the cash flows you are discounting.
  - Riskier investment, higher return.
+ Discounting: move CF back in time (\\(t<0\\))
+ Compounding: move CF forward in time (\\(t>0\\))
+ Never add/subtract cash flows from different time periods
+ Use a timeline to help formulate problems
+ Present value:
  - denote: \\(PV_{s}(CF_{t})\\) as of time \\(s\\) of a cash flow at time \\(t>s\\)
  - meaning:
    + the value of future cash flows
    + the price of a claim to those cash flows

### Mod2. Time Value of Money: Compounding
+ Future value:
  - denote: \\(FV_{s}(CF_{t})\\)
  - \\(FV_{s}(CF_{t})=CF_{t}(1+R)^{s-t}\\) for \\(t<s\\)

### Mod3.
